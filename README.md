**Please note that this is an experiment. If you have feature requests, please submit a PR or fork and use the code any way you need.**

For a full demo, check out the [githubocto/repo-visualizer](https://github.com/githubocto/repo-visualizer) repository.

A path (relative to the root of your repo) to where you would like the diagram to live.

For example: images/diagram.svg

Default: node_modules,bower_components,dist,out,build,eject,.next,.netlify,.yarn,.vscode,package-lock.json,yarn.lock

## `max_depth`
